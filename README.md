## Languges used

### HTML

HTML being the content for any webpage you can see I have used it in all my projects.
I have even used some HTML in my javascript only projects just to make them usable
for anyone who wished to try them.

### CSS 

CSS is another essensial languge for any website as it provides the style (colour, layout)
and also the responsive design. Responsive design being when a page reacts to different
size screens.

### Javascript

Javascript is a massive part of almost any programme. Its used in multiple ways such as 
making webpages interactive or retreaving information from the server side.
Javascript is also used for testing and is used for communication between the front and backend.
Everything I have learned in tearms of logic for my projects has been done through javascript.

I will udate this file as I progress.
